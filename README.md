# K-means-Clustering

This project was done as Final project for Introdaction to ML at ACA, which I passed successfully.

The exel file contains Fifa 2020 complete player dataset at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset).

The project uses the data from Fifa 2020 complete player dataset for K-means clustering from scratch and by using library scikit-learn, and after camparing the result with real data.
